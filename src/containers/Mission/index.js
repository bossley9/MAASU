            <b>The Midwest Asian American Students Union</b> (MAASU) is an
            organization that began in response to a need for political unity
            among Asian American students in the Midwest. By 1990, there were
            more than 20 universities in the Midwest that had formed Asian
            Pacific Islander American (APIA) organizations. Some had been around
            for years, while others were still in their infancy.

          <p>
            Students felt a need for an organization that would support the
            growth of their groups and organize Midwestern Asian American
            students for political activism. MAASU works to recognize the needs
            of the Asian American community by assisting schools with the
            establishment of Asian American student organizations, promoting
            leadership among students, addressing educational needs and rights
            of the Asian American community, and developing a channel of
            communication among Asian American student organizations in the
            Midwest.
