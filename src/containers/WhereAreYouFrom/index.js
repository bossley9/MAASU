          MAASU strives to tell the story of APIAs (Asian Pacific Islander Americans)
          in the Midwest through the #whereareyoufrom project. The projectâ€™s main goal is
          to combat the question "Where are you from?" that many APIAs are are constantly asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          This question identifies APIAs as foreigners in their own home, making them perpetual
          foreigners when they are not. The #whereareyoufrom project collects the stories of individuals 
          across the Midwest through videos, audio and written stories. The stories we have collected range
          from working professionals to students, family, and friends who grew up in the Midwest.
