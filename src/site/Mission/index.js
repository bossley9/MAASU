            <b>The Midwest Asian American Students Union</b> (MAASU) is an organization that began in response
            to a need for political unity among Asian American students in the Midwest. By 1990, there
            were more than 20 universities in the Midwest that had formed Asian Pacific Islander American
            (APIA) organizations. Some had been around for years, while others were still in their infancy.

          <p>
            Students felt a need for an organization that would support the growth of their groups and organize
            Midwestern Asian American students for political activism. MAASU works to recognize the needs of
            the Asian American community by assisting schools with the establishment of Asian American student
            organizations, promoting leadership among students, addressing educational needs and rights of
            the Asian American community, and developing a channel of communication among Asian American
            student organizations in the Midwest.
